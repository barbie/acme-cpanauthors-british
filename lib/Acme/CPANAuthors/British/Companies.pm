=head1 NAME

Acme::CPANAuthors::British::Companies - We are British Companies with PAUSE IDs

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Acme::CPANAuthors;

   my $authors  = Acme::CPANAuthors->new("British::Companies");

   my $number   = $authors->count;
   my @ids      = $authors->id;
   my @distros  = $authors->distributions("FOTANGO");
   my $url      = $authors->avatar_url("PROFERO");

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a hash of British Companies who have PAUSE IDs, to be used 
with the C<Acme::CPANAuthors> module.

This module was created as an addition to the British CPANAuthors module, due
to the number of British Companies that have decided to register their own
PAUSE account.

=head1 MAINTENANCE

If you are a British Company with a PAUSE account not listed here, please send 
me your ID/name via email or RT, so I can always keep this module up to date. 
If there are any mistakes and you're listed here but are not a British Company
(or just don't want to be listed), sorry for the inconvenience: please contact 
me as above and I'll remove the entry right away.

Please note that British Company implies that the head office reside in 
England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland.
